my portfolio website

#viewport Sizes
for the responsive design, I made three different CSS files:
- mobile.css:for screens up to 600px (phones).  
- tablet.css : for screens from 601px to 900px (tablets).  
- laptop.css :for screens above 901px (laptops/desktops).  

#responsive design

I chose these breakpoints because:
- 481px and below fits smaller devices like smartphones.  
- 482px to 901px is a good range for tablets and medium-sized screens.  
- above 901px is for laptops and desktops where there is more screen space.

i picked these sizes because they are common screen sizes, and it made the site adjust better when i tested it on smaller and bigger screens.

#gradients
- i used a linear gradient in the header of all pages (blue to purple).  
- i also used another linear gradient that goes straight down for the background of my projects page.  


#color scheme
i made a color scheme using adobe color
(https://color.adobe.com/create).  
here are the colors I used:
- Blue: #3498db
- Purple: #9b59b6
- Dark gray: #333333
- Light gray: #f9f9f9
- White: #ffffff

i chose these because i like how the blue and purple look together, and the gray/white makes it easier to read the text.

#External Code
- I used some elements of the code from the recent tutorial #4 as inspiriation for my media quieries
