my portfolio website
it has 4 pages: Home, About Me, Projects, and Contact. i used HTML5 and CSS3, and i hosted it on GitHub Pages.

#viewport Sizes
for the responsive design, I made three different CSS files:
- mobile.css:for screens up to 600px (phones).  
- tablet.css : for screens from 601px to 900px (tablets).  
- laptop.css :for screens above 901px (laptops/desktops).  

#responsive design

I chose these breakpoints because:
- 481px and below fits smaller devices like smartphones.  
- 482px to 901px is a good range for tablets and medium-sized screens.  
- above 901px is for laptops and desktops where there is more screen space.

i picked these sizes because they are common screen sizes, and it made the site adjust better when i tested it on smaller and bigger screens.

i also didnt use flexbox since the assignment does not allow it, i used inline-block and block elements along with widths and margins to adjust the layout.


#gradients
- i used a linear gradient in the header of all pages (blue to purple).  
- i also used another linear gradient that goes 135 deg froim the top right to the bottom right for the background of my projects page.  


#color scheme 
here are the colors I used:
- Blue: #3498db
- Purple: #9b59b6
- Dark gray: #333333
- Light gray: #f9f9f9
- White: #ffffff

i chose these because i like how the blue and purple look together, and the gray/white makes it easier to read the text.
#Testing

- HTML and CSS validated with no major errors.  
- Links checked with the W3C link checker.  
- Ran accessibility check on WAVE and spell-checked my text.

Note: the reason that I had to embed the video instead of inputting the video with html controlsis due to an issue with githubs large file policy, which doesn't allow files larger than 100 mb to be uploaded.

#External Code
- I used some elements of the code from the recent tutorial #4 as inspiriation for my media quieries 
- For my contact.html page, I refered to the lecture material regarding the form element etc.

https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_youtube.asp
-   I used W3Schools as a reference for the HTML video embedding (iframe element) for a youtube video instead of inputting a large video file into github LFS, and i also used form validation attributes like "required" and "pattern".

https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp
- I looked at examples of HTML forms and input validation using this cite as well.

-i made a color scheme using adobe color
(https://color.adobe.com/create).

  i referred to MDN for CSS gradient syntax (linear and angle gradients)
